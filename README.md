# Automatic-Door-System
The **Automatic Door System** project, implemented using ladder logic in LogixPro, automates door operations for enhanced convenience and security. Sensors detect when individuals approach the door, automatically triggering the door to open. Once the person has passed through, the system closes the door. The ladder logic program ensures precise control and timing, managing the doorâ€™s movements to respond to sensor inputs effectively and maintain smooth operation. This system is ideal for both commercial and residential settings, improving access while maintaining security.
